A Segmented Button Control in pure Xamarin.Forms!
===========

A Segmented Button Control, or as some call it Grouped Button Control, or Tabbed Button Control or some even call the Rocker Control, is what I'm gonna share with yol today, built 100% from Xamarin.Forms!

Yeah such a platform specific UI element, right out of Xamarin.Forms without a single line of native code, how's that even? Well if you've been following my blog for a while, you know that I'm all about pushing them limits of any given platform and achieve the impossibru! ;)

Started this off as a fun experientant implementation which blew into a fool-proof awesomeness which I have broken into two parts, Simple and Advanced implementation in my blog!

Part 1: Simple Segmented Button Control in pure Xamarin.Forms!
---------------

A very simple Segmented Button Control which has two Tab Button elements but with cool features such as setting Text, Colors and SelectedIndex, etc... And most of all with full looks and feel of a native Segmented Button control!

Part 2: Advanced Segmented Button Control in pure Xamarin.Forms!
---------------

An advanced Segmented Button Control which has awesome features such as dynamically adding or removing Tab Button elements, setting Colors, and Selected Tab index at run time with full native features and looks and feel!

**more awesome stuff...**

just to show how powerful this awesomeness is, I cooked up bit of a cool demo right here running on iOS and Android!
